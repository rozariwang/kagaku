"""
 Contains the class _NetNode_ which is used to represent nodes in neural nets

**Network Architecture:**

  A tacit assumption in all of this stuff is that we're dealing with
  feedforward networks.

  The network itself is stored as a list of _NetNode_ objects.  The list
  is ordered in the sense that nodes in earlier/later layers than a
  given node are guaranteed to come before/after that node in the list.
  This way we can easily generate the values of each node by moving
  sequentially through the list, we're guaranteed that every input for a
  node has already been filled in.

  Each node stores a list (_inputNodes_) of indices of its inputs in the
  main node list.

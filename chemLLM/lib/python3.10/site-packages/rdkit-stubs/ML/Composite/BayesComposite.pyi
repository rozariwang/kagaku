"""
 code for dealing with Bayesian composite models

For a model to be useable here, it should support the following API:

  - _ClassifyExample(example)_, returns a classification

Other compatibility notes:

 1) To use _Composite.Grow_ there must be some kind of builder
    functionality which returns a 2-tuple containing (model,percent accuracy).

 2) The models should be pickleable

 3) It would be very happy if the models support the __cmp__ method so that
    membership tests used to make sure models are unique work.

           2) call AverageErrors to calculate the average error values

 command line utility for building composite models

#DOC

**Usage**

  BuildComposite [optional args] filename

Unless indicated otherwise (via command line arguments), _filename_ is
a QDAT file.

**Command Line Arguments**

  - -o *filename*: name of the output file for the pickled composite

  - -n *num*: number of separate models to add to the composite

  - -p *tablename*: store persistence data in the database
     in table *tablename*

  - -N *note*: attach some arbitrary text to the persistence data

  - -b *filename*: name of the text file to hold examples from the
     holdout set which are misclassified

  - -s: split the data into training and hold-out sets before building
     the composite

  - -f *frac*: the fraction of data to use in the training set when the
     data is split

  - -r: randomize the activities (for testing purposes).  This ignores
     the initial distribution of activity values and produces each
     possible activity value with equal likliehood.

  - -S: shuffle the activities (for testing purposes) This produces
     a permutation of the input activity values.

  - -l: locks the random number generator to give consistent sets
     of training and hold-out data.  This is primarily intended
     for testing purposes.

  - -B: use a so-called Bayesian composite model.

  - -d *database name*: instead of reading the data from a QDAT file,
     pull it from a database.  In this case, the _filename_ argument
     provides the name of the database table containing the data set.

  - -D: show a detailed breakdown of the composite model performance
     across the training and, when appropriate, hold-out sets.

  - -P *pickle file name*: write out the pickled data set to the file

  - -F *filter frac*: filters the data before training to change the
     distribution of activity values in the training set.  *filter
     frac* is the fraction of the training set that should have the
     target value.  **See note below on data filtering.**

  - -v *filter value*: filters the data before training to change the
     distribution of activity values in the training set. *filter
     value* is the target value to use in filtering.  **See note below
     on data filtering.**

  - --modelFiltFrac *model filter frac*: Similar to filter frac above,
     in this case the data is filtered for each model in the composite
     rather than a single overall filter for a composite. *model
     filter frac* is the fraction of the training set for each model
     that should have the target value (*model filter value*).

  - --modelFiltVal *model filter value*: target value to use for
     filtering data before training each model in the composite.

  - -t *threshold value*: use high-confidence predictions for the
     final analysis of the hold-out data.

  - -Q *list string*: the values of quantization bounds for the
     activity value.  See the _-q_ argument for the format of *list
     string*.

  - --nRuns *count*: build *count* composite models

  - --prune: prune any models built

  - -h: print a usage message and exit.

  - -V: print the version number and exit

  *-*-*-*-*-*-*-*- Tree-Related Options -*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*

  - -g: be less greedy when training the models.

  - -G *number*: force trees to be rooted at descriptor *number*.

  - -L *limit*: provide an (integer) limit on individual model
     complexity

  - -q *list string*: Add QuantTrees to the composite and use the list
     specified in *list string* as the number of target quantization
     bounds for each descriptor.  Don't forget to include 0's at the
     beginning and end of *list string* for the name and value fields.
     For example, if there are 4 descriptors and you want 2 quant
     bounds apiece, you would use _-q "[0,2,2,2,2,0]"_.
     Two special cases:
       1) If you would like to ignore a descriptor in the model
          building, use '-1' for its number of quant bounds.
       2) If you have integer valued data that should not be quantized
          further, enter 0 for that descriptor.

  - --recycle: allow descriptors to be used more than once in a tree

  - --randomDescriptors=val: toggles growing random forests with val
      randomly-selected descriptors available at each node.


  *-*-*-*-*-*-*-*- KNN-Related Options -*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*

  - --doKnn: use K-Nearest Neighbors models

  - --knnK=*value*: the value of K to use in the KNN models

  - --knnTanimoto: use the Tanimoto metric in KNN models

  - --knnEuclid: use a Euclidean metric in KNN models

  *-*-*-*-*-*-*- Naive Bayes Classifier Options -*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*
  - --doNaiveBayes : use Naive Bayes classifiers

  - --mEstimateVal : the value to be used in the m-estimate formula
      If this is greater than 0.0, we use it to compute the conditional
      probabilities by the m-estimate

  *-*-*-*-*-*-*-*- SVM-Related Options -*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*

  **** NOTE: THESE ARE DISABLED ****

# #   - --doSVM: use Support-vector machines

# #   - --svmKernel=*kernel*: choose the type of kernel to be used for
# #     the SVMs.  Options are:
# #     The default is:

# #   - --svmType=*type*: choose the type of support-vector machine
# #     to be used.  Options are:
# #     The default is:

# #   - --svmGamma=*gamma*: provide the gamma value for the SVMs.  If this
# #     is not provided, a grid search will be carried out to determine an
# #     optimal *gamma* value for each SVM.

# #   - --svmCost=*cost*: provide the cost value for the SVMs.  If this is
# #     not provided, a grid search will be carried out to determine an
# #     optimal *cost* value for each SVM.

# #   - --svmWeights=*weights*: provide the weight values for the
# #     activities.  If provided this should be a sequence of (label,
# #     weight) 2-tuples *nActs* long.  If not provided, a weight of 1
# #     will be used for each activity.

# #   - --svmEps=*epsilon*: provide the epsilon value used to determine
# #     when the SVM has converged.  Defaults to 0.001

# #   - --svmDegree=*degree*: provide the degree of the kernel (when
# #     sensible) Defaults to 3

# #   - --svmCoeff=*coeff*: provide the coefficient for the kernel (when
# #     sensible) Defaults to 0

# #   - --svmNu=*nu*: provide the nu value for the kernel (when sensible)
# #     Defaults to 0.5

# #   - --svmDataType=*float*: if the data is contains only 1 and 0 s, specify by
# #     using binary. Defaults to float

# #   - --svmCache=*cache*: provide the size of the memory cache (in MB)
# #     to be used while building the SVM.  Defaults to 40

**Notes**

  - *Data filtering*: When there is a large disparity between the
    numbers of points with various activity levels present in the
    training set it is sometimes desirable to train on a more
    homogeneous data set.  This can be accomplished using filtering.
    The filtering process works by selecting a particular target
    fraction and target value.  For example, in a case where 95% of
    the original training set has activity 0 and ony 5% activity 1, we
    could filter (by randomly removing points with activity 0) so that
    30% of the data set used to build the composite has activity 1.
